# YTAssistiveTouch
A Modeled on the system  view (AssistiveTouch)

Notes
----
    Because `YTAssistiveTouch` inherits from UIWindow, after iOS7, in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` UIWindow rootviewcontroller must be specified, so `YTAssistiveTouch` must create display after `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` implementation.
